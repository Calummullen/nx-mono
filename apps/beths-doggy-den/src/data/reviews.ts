I have no doubt that he was well looked after & loved. I am so glad I‚Äôve found Beth & have already booked up with her for the remainder of this year!',

      'Beth was the first person that we had left our baby with and as you can imagine we were nervous. we did not need to worry as Chunk instantly clicked with her and you can clearly see how much she loves dogs and enjoys spending time with them. Beth kept us updated with photos and videos and Chunk enjoyed his stay with her so much that he got really excited when we took him back for a second and a third time! We shall definitely be using Beth again and I have no hesitation in recommending her.',

      "Xena had the best time at Beth's home over night. Having not met Beth before, Xena waltzed straight in and made herself at home, not even noticing we'd left (despite it being her first night away from us). Beth sent lots of pictures of Xena to update us. I'm sure Xena will be excited to stay again soon - thanks Beth",

      "My little chap Harry has absolutely thrived with Beth. He adores his time with her when I am working and has clearly benefitted with the social interaction with the other dogs he sometimes meets when she's looking after him. Beth has such a friendly, warm and inviting manner that it's impossible for any dog not to quickly feel at home. Harry certainly seems very relaxed and happy with her - in fact so much so that I sometimes wonder if he wants to come home with me!! Beth is great at keeping me involved in Harry's care, with regular updates and photos snapped during the day (she took this handsome snap). It's a lovely touch and makes me feel easier about our time apart. She also lets me know how he's been during the day, when I go to pick him up, and so I always know that he's in good, safe hands. I thoroughly recommend Beth and know that if Harry could write, he would do so too. She's an absolute star! Thank you so much Beth.",

Our Barney bear is 58kg of lovable Bernese Mountain dog which didn‚Äôt phase Beth in the slightest. Beth is a true professional with a wonderful aptitude with dogs. We are so grateful to have found her.',

      'Beth is exactly what I was looking for and I‚Äôm so happy to have found her! Bobbie is a bundle of fun but has separation anxiety so I‚Äôm very particular about who I leave her with. Bobbie took to Beth immediately without any fuss and if Bobbie trusts her then I certainly do! I‚Äôm sent really frequent updates of Bobbie having the best time ever, which is so reassuring. The other thing which is really important to me is Beth assures me she never leaves the dogs alone. Other dog sitters I‚Äôve used haven‚Äôt been able to commit to this which makes life really difficult when you have a dog with separation anxiety (and can undo all the hard work you‚Äôve put in training them to be alone). So I‚Äôm really grateful to know Bobbie always has company when she stays with Beth. Your dog will be safe and happy with Beth ‚ù§Ô∏è',

      'Beth is absolutely amazing! I got a great vibe from her profile straight away and knew my Bobbie would love her. And was even more reassured when I dropped Bobbie off for the first time. It was all super last minute and Beth was so lovely and accommodating - she really helped me out at a tricky moment. I had constant updates and felt really calm and reassured. I know Bobbie had the best time ever and will love coming back again very soon. Thank you! Lisa and Bobbie x',

He also got to play with another little doggy that seemed very happy when we meet him and that is always a great sign. Would definitely recommend.',

She has walked my own dog Meatball for months now and I completely trust her with this responsibility. I believe you would be doing yourselves a great injustice not to pick her for your service, she is an amazing human being and I think of her in the highest regards.
